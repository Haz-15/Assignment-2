#A Brief History of Linux, Unix, and Ubuntu
- LINUX

Linux, an open source O.S., was originally released on September 17th, 1991 and has been updated ever since then.
It was originally created as a personal project by Linus Torvalds, ever since creation, it’s been constantly updated. 
Torvalds never even intended for the program to reach the heights it did, stating “I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones”. 
The mascot for Linux, a well-known penguin, originally came from a zoo visit where Torvalds somehow managed to get himself bitten by one.

- UNIX

Unix,  a family of multitasking, multi user computer operating systems, was originally created around the mid-1960’s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. 
The name “Unix” or “(Uniplexed Information and Computing Service” was actually a joke based off of on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services), 
another operation systems at the time that actually influenced the development for O.S. to come.

- Ubuntu

Ubuntu is built on Debian's architecture and infrastructure, and comprises Linux server, desktop and discontinued phone and tablet operating system versions.
Ubuntu releases updated versions predictably every six months, and each release receives free support for nine months (eighteen months prior to 13.04) with security fixes, high-impact bug fixes and conservative, 
substantially beneficial low-risk bug fixes. The first release was in October 2004
